#### Members: Bug Lee, Adil Sheikh, Keeling Wood, Justin Hughes 

## Base PintOS
This repository was built upon the Virginia Tech version of PintOS (pintos-2017), which spawned off Stanford's in 2009. The base PintOS include support for PCI, USB, and as of 2017, multiple processors.

## Added features
1. [User programs](reports/proj2_user_prog.md)
2. [Improved virtual memory](reports/proj3_virtual_mem.md)
3. [Improved file system (buffer cache, file extension, subdirectories)](reports/proj4_file_sys.md)
4. [Dynamic memory allocation](reports/proj5_dynamic_mem.md)
5. Unix features (fork/exec, piping, shell, etc) [Proposal](reports/proj5_modeling_unix_proposal.md), [Presentation](reports/final_presentation.pdf)
